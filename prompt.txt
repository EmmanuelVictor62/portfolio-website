I want to build a stunning, animated, professional portfolio website using **React.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced with **Framer Motion** for smooth, scroll-triggered and hover animations (similar in feel to https://nubien.framer.website).

The portfolio represents **Emmanuel Victor**, a Fullstack Developer and **Automation Specialist**, showcasing:
- My skills, roles, and tools
- My best projects and automation workflows
- Ways for people to contact or schedule a meeting with me
- A clear personal brand as a modern, reliable problem solver using automation and software engineering

### 💼 Context & Bio:
I have worked as:
- Lead Automation Specialist at **Northsnow Ltd**, United Kingdom
- Automation Engineer at **AiNova Systems**, United Kingdom (fictional placeholder for branding)
- Senior Frontend Engineer at **Curator Video**
- Lead Frontend Developer at **AvocadoNG**
- Fullstack Developer & Co-founder at **Bedspace**
- Junior Frontend Developer at **Curator Video**

I specialize in:
- **Automation Tools**: n8n, Zapier, Make, Airtable
- **AI-powered Chatbots** and Workflow automation
- **Coding**: React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Python
- Building scalable, clean, and efficient user interfaces
- Real-time systems using WebSocket, API integrations (REST/GraphQL), and cloud (AWS)

### 🔧 Portfolio Website Requirements:
- **Dark-themed modern design** with clean typography, padding, smooth scroll, and framer-style animations
- Responsive for **mobile and desktop**
- Eye-catching **Hero Section** with animated intro about who I am, and what I do
- **About Me Section** with short background, key achievements, and a clean layout
- **Projects Section** featuring the **exact projects/workflows** from this Notion portfolio:  
  https://www.notion.so/Portfolio-219c5599124880f5b108ea88a1a3beac  
  → Group projects under categories like:
  - Workflow Automations
  - AI Chatbots
  - Fullstack Projects
  - Integrations

  Each project should include:
  - Title
  - Short description
  - Tools used
  - Optional image or GIF preview
  - GitHub or demo link (optional)

- **Services Section** with cards or sections for:
  - AI-powered Chatbots
  - Automated Workflows
  - Business Automation Consultancy
  - Custom Integrations

- **Contact Section** with:
  - Contact form (Name, Email, Message) that sends form data via EmailJS or webhook
  - Button to **Book a Call via Calendly**  
    (use placeholder link: `https://calendly.com/emmanuel-victor`)

- **Resume Section** with buttons:
  - **View My Resume** (open in new tab)
  - **Download Resume** (PDF download)

- **Footer Section** with social media links, email, and copyright

### 📁 Folder Structure Suggestion:
```

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   ├── Hero.jsx
│   ├── About.jsx
│   ├── Projects.jsx
│   ├── Services.jsx
│   ├── Contact.jsx
│   ├── Footer.jsx
│   └── Resume.jsx
├── assets/
│   └── images/
├── data/
│   └── projects.js
├── App.jsx
├── index.js

```

### 📦 Required NPM Packages:
- `framer-motion` for animations
- `tailwindcss` for utility styling
- `emailjs-com` or `formspree` for contact form submissions
- `react-icons` for iconography
- `react-router-dom` (if routing is needed)
- Optionally `react-scroll` for smooth scrolling

### 🧠 Extra Instructions:
- Use placeholder text and images where needed, but structure everything so I can easily replace content.
- Animations should be subtle, performant, and clean — not distracting.
- Add smooth scrolling to sections.
- Add scroll-triggered fade-ins or slide-ins for key sections using `Framer Motion`.
- Set up basic SEO metadata with `react-helmet`.

Build the full UI and install all necessary packages. Start with layout scaffolding, and generate reusable, well-named components.
